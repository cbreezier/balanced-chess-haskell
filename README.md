# Balanced Chess
Balanced chess is a game that resembles chess, yet has nothing to do with it. The player who gets to move first in chess has a distinct advantage. But how large is that advantage? How can chess truly be balanced until we know the exact quantifiable advantage from going first?

The answer is to rework the idea of turns entirely. Both players will play simultaneously, resulting in a truly balanced game.
